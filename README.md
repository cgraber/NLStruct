Code used to produce experimental results for the paper "Deep Structured Prediction with Nonlinear Output Activations"

Hi there! I am working on transitioning the code used in this paper from a private repo (which contains additional code related to future, unpublished work) to here. Please check back later! I plan on completing the move before the dates of the actual NIPS conference.
